# Route-Snake
**Route-Snake** is a simple program that leverages the Google Maps API to make a more functional route time estimator/planner. On Google Maps you can find out when to leave to arrive somewhere at a certain time, but that functionality is gone when you string places together. This is what I aim to solve with **Route-Snake.**
